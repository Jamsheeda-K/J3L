"""
Spiced Academy creat a Monte Carlo Markov Chain Simulation

Write a Customer class that represents a single customer in the supermarket.
Uses a transition probability matrix to simulate the journey of a single customer through the market. 
Use a Markov model to represent the state of a customer. 
Use one-minute time intervals for the transitions.
Once a customer reaches the checkout, consider them churned – do not simulate them any longer.
As attributes, the class should take in an id, a transition probability matrix 
(which you extracted earlier from the Data Analysis section) and an initial state:
